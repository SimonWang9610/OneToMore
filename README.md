# OneToMore
This will be an experimental project powered by JavaScript, React, WebAssembly and Blockchain.

For this project, we try to go through some popular technical concepts and fancy tech stacks. Therefore, our goals are not to provide best practices for all web scenarios.

## Code requirements for better practices

- Explicitly writing cross-file calls in comments, or __depicting it in a flowchart__.
- Avoiding meaningless function names
- Code is logic. if not, please write explicit comments inside function definitions.
- Keeping organized and modularized, not making something chaos

## Bugs and ideas
- before opening an issue for bugs, please enter `Discussion` first and then open an issue if your problems are confirmed as bugs
- Any idea is warmly acceptable and appreciated. You can discuss your ideas at `Discussion` for this project.

## Tech stacks 
- `React.js` for front-end (ongoing)
- `Express.js` for back-end (ongoing)
- `Quill.js` for Rich Text Editor (ongoing)
- `WebAssembly` for `Web Games` (future)
- `AI deployment` (future)
- `Blockchain: IPFS` for storage (future)
- `Vue.js` for front-end (future)

## First stage (ongoing)
At the initial stage of our project, we want to build:
- `Authentication`. It is very important for some websites to verify their subscribed users and then give the permissions to them. Therefore, we want to implement such a workflow of authentication to understand something that may pose threats to websites' security.
  - such a workflow can also make us familiar with `Form validation`
- `Article`. As we know, another important thing for users is to express themselves on the Internet. Therefore, to provide a powerful Rich Text Editor seems very interesting and requisite. At this time, [Quill.js](https://quilljs.com/) should be the editor we want.

## Next stage (future)
- `WebAssembly`: After completing the first stage, we will prefer adding `Web Games` in our projects. We think `WebAssembly` can help us write high-performance web games. However, we have not given it a try yet. 
- `AI deployment`: In particular, it seems also very fancy to deploy AI models using WebAssembly on the Web. It will be also possible to merge AI elements in our web games powered by `WebAssembly`. 
- `Blockchain`: when it comes to Blockchain, we also do not want to build a robust Blockchain application. We just think it may help us understand `Blockchain` better and try something advanced. If we could store users' static assets on Blockchain, it will be very interesting.
- `Streaming services`. Deploying such services can help us understand how streaming media works better, but we prefer putting them later. Such as `Audio streaming`, `Video streaming` and `Live streaming`
